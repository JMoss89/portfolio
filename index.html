    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is July. I am a software developer graduated from Manchester Codes.</p>
    <p>I did a programming introduction course while I was considering to switch career path to a skill-based type of job. I was addicted to the sense of achievement by overcoming the challenges that come with coding, and I never want to stop since then.</p>
